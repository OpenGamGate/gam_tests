Warning -> 008 need 'random hit' while 020 need 'post hit' ? 


# tests 013 (physics lists)

Test 13 with physics lists. 

Errror for nÂ°3 (different number of track). Don't know why. Not clear how the "decay" is handle in Gate. Maybe related to "G4UAtomicDeexcitation" or "PIXE model" ?

Only since the PR https://github.com/OpenGATE/Gate/pull/440


# test 019 (phsp)

Sometime, the following error appears: `std::runtime_error: pybind11_object_dealloc()`
